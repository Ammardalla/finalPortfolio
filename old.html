        <h2 style="line-height: 16px;">Assassin's_Creed</h2>
        <p class="p1">Assassin's Creed is a historical action-adventure video game series and media franchise published by Ubisoft and developed 
            mainly by its studio Ubisoft Montreal using the game engine Anvil and its more advanced derivatives. Created by Patrice Désilets, 
            Jade Raymond, and Corey May, the Assassin's Creed video game series depicts a fictional millennia-old struggle between the Order 
            of Assassins, who fight for peace and free will, and the Knights Templar, who desire peace through order and control. The series 
            features historical fiction, science fiction, and fictional characters intertwined with real-world historical events and 
            historical figures. In most games, players control a historical Assassin while also playing as an Assassin Initiate or someone 
            caught in the Assassin–Templar conflict in the present-day framing story. Considered a spiritual successor to the Prince of Persia 
            series, Assassin's Creed took inspiration from the novel Alamut by the Slovenian writer Vladimir Bartol, based on the historical 
            Hashashin sect of the medieval Iran (Persia).
            The first Assassin's Creed game was released in 2007, and the series has featured thirteen main installments in total, the most 
            recent being Assassin's Creed Mirage in 2023. Main games in the Assassin's Creed series are set in an open world and played from 
            the third-person view. Gameplay revolves around combat, stealth, and exploration, including the use of parkour to navigate the 
            environment. The games feature both main and side missions, and some titles also include competitive and cooperative multiplayer 
            game modes.
            A new story and occasionally new time periods are introduced in each entry, with the gameplay elements also evolving. There are 
            three overarching story arcs in the series. The first five main games follow Desmond Miles, a descendant of several important
             Assassins throughout history, who uses a machine called the Animus to relive his ancestors' memories and find powerful artifacts 
             called Pieces of Eden in an attempt to prevent a catastrophic event, referencing the 2012 phenomenon. From Assassin's Creed IV: 
             Black Flag to Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Assassin initiates and employees of Abstergo Industries (a company used as a front by 
             the modern-day Templars) record genetic memories using the Helix software, helping the Templars and Assassins find new Pieces of 
             Eden in the modern world. The next three games, Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, follow ex-Abstergo employee 
             Layla Hassan on her own quest to save humanity from another disaster.</p>

        <h2 style="line-height: 16px;">Grand_Theft_Auto</h2>
        <p class="p1">Grand Theft Auto (GTA) is an action-adventure video game series created by David Jones and Mike Dailly.Later titles were
             developed under the oversight of brothers Dan and Sam Houser, Leslie Benzies and Aaron Garbut. It is primarily developed by 
             British development house Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), and published by its American parent company, Rockstar Games. 
             The name of the series is a term for motor vehicle theft in the United States.
            Gameplay focuses on an open world where the player can complete missions to progress an overall story, as well as engage in 
            various side activities. Most of the gameplay revolves around driving and shooting, with occasional role-playing and stealth 
            elements. The series also has elements of the earlier beat 'em up games from the 16-bit era. The games in the Grand Theft Auto 
            series are set in fictional locales modelled after real-life cities, at various points in time from the early 1960s to the 2010s. 
            The original game's map encompassed three cities—Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco),
            and Vice City (based on Miami)—but later titles tend to focus on a single setting and expand upon the original three locales. 
            Each game in the series centres on different respective protagonist who attempts to rise through the criminal underworld due to 
            various motives, often accompanying themes of betrayal. Several film and music veterans have voiced characters in the games, 
            including Ray Liotta, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, William Fichtner, James Woods, Debbie Harry, Axl Rose and Peter Fonda.
            DMA Design began the series in 1997, with the release of the Grand Theft Auto. As of 2020, the series consists of seven standalone 
            titles and four expansion packs. The third main title, Grand Theft Auto III, released in 2001, is considered a landmark game, 
            and brought the series into a three-dimensional environment for the first time. Subsequent titles have followed and built upon 
            the format established by Grand Theft Auto III, receiving significant acclaim. The games influenced other open-world games, 
            and led to the label Grand Theft Auto clone on similar titles.
            The series has been critically acclaimed, with all the main 3D entries in the franchise frequently ranked among the greatest 
            and best-selling video games;[5] it has shipped more than 425 million units, making it one of the best-selling video game 
            franchises. In 2006, Grand Theft Auto was featured in a list of British design icons in the Great British Design Quest 
            organised by the BBC and the Design Museum.In 2013, The Telegraph ranked Grand Theft Auto among Britain's most successful 
            exports.The series has also been controversial for its adult nature and violent themes, as well as for cut content.</p>

        <h2 style="line-height: 16px;">Resident-evil</h2>
        <p class="p1">Resident Evil, known as Biohazard in Japan, is a Japanese horror game series and media franchise created by Capcom. It consists 
            of survival horror, third-person shooter and first-person shooter games, with players typically surviving in environments 
            inhabited by zombies and other frightening creatures. The franchise has expanded into other media, including a live-action 
            film series, animated films, television series, comic books, novels, audiobooks, and merchandise. Resident Evil is the 
            highest-grossing horror franchise.
            The first Resident Evil game was created by Shinji Mikami and Tokuro Fujiwara for PlayStation, and released in 1996.It is
             credited for defining the survival horror genre and returning zombies to popular culture. With Resident Evil 4 (2005), 
             the franchise shifted to more dynamic shooting action, popularizing the "over-the-shoulder" third-person view in action-adventure 
             games.
            The franchise returned to survival horror with Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (2017) and Resident Evil Village (2021), which used 
            a first-person perspective. Capcom has also released four Resident Evil remakes: Resident Evil (2002), Resident Evil 2 (2019), 
            Resident Evil 3 (2020) and Resident Evil 4 (2023). Resident Evil is Capcom's best-selling franchise and the best-selling horror 
            game series, with 154 million copies sold worldwide as of December 2023.
            The first Resident Evil film was released in 2002, starring Milla Jovovich, followed by five further sequels and a reboot, 
            Welcome to Raccoon City (2021). The films received mostly negative reviews, but have grossed more than $1.2 billion, making 
            Resident Evil the third-highest-grossing video game film series.
            The development of the first Resident Evil, released as Biohazard in Japan, began in 1993 when Capcom's Tokuro Fujiwara told 
            Shinji Mikami and other co-workers to create a game using elements from Fujiwara's 1989 game Sweet Home on the Family Computer 
            (Famicom) in Japan.When in late 1994 marketing executives were setting up to release Biohazard in the United States, 
            it was pointed out that securing the rights to the name Biohazard would be very difficult as a DOS game had been registered 
            under that name, as well as a New York hardcore punk band called Biohazard. A contest was held among company personnel to 
            choose a new name; this competition turned up Resident Evil, the name under which it was released in the west.Resident Evil 
            made its debut on the PlayStation in 1996 and was later ported to the Sega Saturn.</p>

        <h2 style="line-height: 16px;">The_Elder_Scrolls</h2>
        <p class="p1">The Elder Scrolls is a series of action role-playing video games primarily developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by 
            Bethesda Softworks. The series focuses on free-form gameplay in an open world. Most games in the series have been critically and 
            commercially successful, with The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind (2002), The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (2006) 
            and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (2011) all winning Game of the Year awards from multiple outlets. The series has sold more 
            than 59 million copies worldwide.
            Within the series' fictional universe, each game takes place on the continent of Tamriel. The setting combines pre-medieval 
            real-world elements, such as a powerful Roman-like Empire, with high fantasy medieval themes, including limited technology, 
            widespread magic use, and the existence of many mythological creatures. The continent is split into a number of provinces 
            inhabited by humans and humanoid fantasy races such as elves, orcs and anthropomorphic animals. A common theme in the lore is 
            that a chosen hero (represented by the player's character) rises to defeat an impending threat, typically a malevolent being 
            or an antagonistic army.
            Since debuting with The Elder Scrolls: Arena in 1994, the series has produced a total of five main games 
            (of which the last three have each featured two or three expansions) as well as several spin-offs.In 2014, a massively
            multiplayer online role-playing game, The Elder Scrolls Online, was released by Bethesda's affiliated ZeniMax subsidiary ZeniMax 
            Online Studios.
            Development history Before The Elder Scrolls Prior to working on The Elder Scrolls series, Bethesda had worked predominantly 
            with sports and action games. In the six years from its founding to Arena's 1994 release, Bethesda had released ten games, 
            six of them sports games,with such titles as Hockey League Simulator, NCAA Basketball: Road to the Final Four ('91/'92 Edition), 
            and Wayne Gretzky Hockey,and the remaining four adaptations from other media,primarily the Terminator series.Bethesda's 
            course changed abruptly when it began working on its first action role-playing game. Designer Ted Peterson recalls: "I remember 
            talking to the guys at Sir-Tech who were doing Wizardry VII: Crusaders of the Dark Savant at the time, and them literally laughing 
            at us for thinking we could do it."Ted Peterson worked alongside Vijay Lakshman as one of the initial designers of what 
            became known as Arena, a "medieval-style gladiator game".</p>

        <h2 style="line-height: 16px;">Tomp_Raider</h2>
        <p class="p1">Tomb Raider, known as Lara Croft: Tomb Raider from 2001 to 2008, is a media franchise that originated with an action-adventure 
            video game series created by British video game developer Core Design. The franchise is currently owned by CDE Entertainment; 
            it was formerly owned by Eidos Interactive, then by Square Enix Europe after Square Enix's acquisition of Eidos in 2009 until 
            Embracer Group purchased the intellectual property alongside Eidos in 2022. The franchise focuses on the fictional British
             archaeologist Lara Croft, who travels around the world searching for lost artefacts and infiltrating dangerous tombs and ruins. 
             Gameplay generally focuses on exploration, solving puzzles, navigating hostile environments filled with traps, and fighting 
             enemies. Additional media has been developed for the franchise in the form of film adaptations, comics and novels.
            Development of the first Tomb Raider began in 1994; it was released two years later. Its critical and commercial success 
            prompted Core Design to develop a new game annually for the next four years, which put a strain on staff. The sixth game, 
            Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness, faced difficulties during development and was considered a failure at release. This prompted 
            Eidos to switch development duties to Crystal Dynamics, which has been the series' primary developer since. Other developers have
            contributed to spin-off titles and ports of mainline entries.
            Tomb Raider games have sold over 95 million copies worldwide by 2022.while the entire franchise generated close to $1.2 billion 
            in revenue by 2002.The series has received generally positive reviews from critics, and Lara Croft has become one of the most 
            recognisable video game protagonists, winning accolades and earning places on the Walk of Game and Guinness World Records.
            The first six Tomb Raider games were developed by Core Design, a British video game development company owned by Eidos Interactive. 
            After the sixth game in the series was released to a mixed reception in 2003, development was transferred to American studio Crystal 
            Dynamics, who have handled the main series since.Since 2001, other developers have contributed either to ports of mainline games or 
            with the development of spin-off titles.Main series
            Tomb Raider, the first entry in the series, was released in 1996 for personal computers (PC), PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles.
            The Saturn and PlayStation versions were released in Japan in 1997.Its sequel, Tomb Raider II, launched in 1997, again for 
            Microsoft Windows and PlayStation. A month before release, Eidos finalised a deal with Sony Computer Entertainment to keep the 
            console version of Tomb Raider II and future games exclusive to PlayStation until the year 2000.The PlayStation version was 
            released in Japan in 1998.Tomb Raider III launched in 1998.As with Tomb Raider II, the PlayStation version released in Japan the 
            following year.</p>

        <h2 style="line-height: 16px;">ZanZarah</h2>
        <p class="p1">ZanZarah: The Hidden Portal is an action-adventure video game by the German company Funatics Development, released in 2002 by the 
            publisher THQ. An expansion was in development in 2002, but was later cancelled. The game involves travels and combats in a
            magical world loosely associated with our own world.
            ZanZarah: The Hidden Portal features a detailed fantasy world called ZanZarah. The Shadow Realm is a place of great evil in the 
            depths of ZanZarah, even deeper than the lava caves of the dwarves. There are a few entrances into it: one is in the pixie-hunter 
            Lucius' cellar where he keeps captured pixies. Another is in the catacombs beneath Tiralin. But the main entrance leading to the 
            shadow realm is hidden deep in the southeastern swamps of ZanZarah.
            Story Long ago, our world and ZanZarah were one. Magical creatures like fairies, elves, dwarves, and goblins lived in peace with 
            humans for a long time; and magic was an important part of our world. But then came the dark times, the times of inquisition and 
            a great magic purge. The magical creatures had to flee from our world to save themselves, and the human Druids, the last wielders 
            of white magic, helped them by creating a world suitable for their existence and closing the way there for the human race.
            For centuries, the two worlds were separated and prospering. The creatures of ZanZarah sometimes visited their former home but 
            generally preferred to stay in the new one. For humans, the way to ZanZarah was forever sealed by a mysterious machine called the 
            Guardian. However, as time passed, the magic world became more and more a prison rather than a paradise for the magic folk. 
            It became harder to cross the border between the worlds, even for the inhabitants of ZanZarah. Wild fairies started attacking 
            the travelers for no apparent reason. Strange creatures calling themselves dark elves appeared on the roads. And the White Druid, 
            the last of the mighty creators of ZanZarah, seemed helpless against them.
            Not only ZanZarah is affected by this strange plague. The ancient, and by that time half-forgotten, world of humans also suffered 
            from a loss of something very important—magic. A prophecy as old as ZanZarah itself tells that when the time comes, a savior will 
            come from the world of humans to restore the balance between the two universes and peace will once again reign between the magic 
            folk and humans. Until then, however, fairies, elves, dwarves, and goblins have to wait and hope.
            The game follows the story of Amy, a young girl from London who on her eighteenth birthday receives the strangest present in her 
            life—a magic rune—from an even stranger creature, a goblin who appears out of nowhere and disappears without saying anything. 
            The rune is one of the teleportation runes that the inhabitants of the magic parallel world ZanZarah employ to travel across their 
            lands.

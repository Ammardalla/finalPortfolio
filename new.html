        <h2 style="line-height: 16px;">DiabloIV</h2>
        <p>Diablo IV is a 2023 online-only action role-playing dungeon crawling game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. It is 
            the fourth main installment in the Diablo series. Announced at BlizzCon 2019, the game was released on June 5, 2023 for the 
            PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X and S, and Microsoft Windows. Players create a character from one of 
            six playable classes—Barbarian, Druid, Necromancer, Rogue, Sorcerer, or Spiritborn—and use their skills to complete quests through
            combat.
            Staple features returned from previous installments in the franchise, such as a focus on replayable, procedurally generated 
            dungeons and loot-focused character-building, while also featuring mechanics new to the series, including an open world and player 
            versus player combat.
            Diablo IV received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the game's narrative and atmosphere. 
            The game generated $666 million in revenue within the first six days after launch.
            Gameplay The core formula for the series' gameplay revolves around gradually obtaining stronger equipment by defeating 
            increasingly difficult enemies.Enemies are fought using different character class skills which can be customized by equipment and 
            talent trees. This concept is used to progress through the story and quests.Enemies are split into monster families which are 
            defined by a theme, combat style, and their location.Each family contains different archetypes that hold different roles allowing 
            for synergies of specialty abilities between family members.To differentiate between them, they have unique silhouettes, stances 
            and weapons.
            Creative director Sebastian Stepien explained that the goal was to create a more "grounded" story than Diablo III.In order to 
            achieve this, the plot revolves around the simple folk of Sanctuary rather than "politics, kings, or another high-fantasy theme.
            The playable character's effectiveness in combat is determined by their attributes and their boosts from equipped items.Offensive
             attributes include attack and critical chance which increase damage output. Defensive stats include elemental resistance and 
             defense which increase how much damage can be taken.Diablo IV introduces three new attributes: Angelic, Demonic, and Ancestral 
             Power. Angelic and Demonic Power alter the duration of beneficial and negative effects respectively. Ancestral Power increases 
             the chance of effects being applied to another entity.Weapons and gear have increasing rarity which are a general indicator of 
             their power. The rarest items have unique effects that alter more than just the character's parameters.In an interview with lead 
             game designer Joe Shely and senior producer Tiffany Wat, it was revealed that trading and crafting will be available in the game 
             but will be limited to resources outside of the most powerful items.

        <h2 style="line-height: 16px;">Elden_Ring</h2>
        <p>Elden Ring is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware. It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding 
            provided by American fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. It was published for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, 
            and Xbox Series X/S on February 25 in Japan by FromSoftware and internationally by Bandai Namco Entertainment. Set in the Lands 
            Between, players control a customizable player character on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.
            Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective with players freely roaming its open world. The six main areas can be 
            traversed using the player character's steed Torrent. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can 
            use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's 
            world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called runes. 
            Elden Ring features an online multiplayer mode in which players join through cooperative play to fight bosses or engage in player 
            versus player combat.
            FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game based on Dark Souls. Miyazaki admired Martin's previous work and hoped that his 
            contributions would produce a more accessible narrative than those of the company's earlier games. Martin was given unrestricted 
            freedom to design the backstory, while Miyazaki was lead writer for the in-game narrative. However, the game's narrative is still 
            presented through flavor text, dialogue, visual narrative, and players' interpretations. The developers concentrated on 
            environmental scale, stat management, and the story; the scale required the construction of several structures around its world.
            Elden Ring won several Game of the Year awards and has been cited as one of the greatest games of all time, with praise directed 
            towards its open world, gameplay systems, and setting despite criticism for its technical performance. It sold 25 million copies, 
            also making it one of the best-selling games of all time. The downloadable content (DLC) Shadow of the Erdtree follows the player 
            character solving the mysteries of the Land of Shadow. It was released in June 2024 to similar acclaim and sold over five million 
            copies.</p>

        <h2 style="line-height: 16px;">Ghost_of_Tsushima</h2>
        <p class="p1">Ghost of Tsushima is a 2020 action-adventure game developed by Sucker Punch Productions and published by Sony Interactive 
            Entertainment. The player controls Jin Sakai, a samurai on a quest to protect Tsushima Island during the first Mongol invasion 
            of Japan. Jin must choose between following the warrior code to fight honorably, or using practical but dishonorable methods of 
            repelling the Mongols with minimal casualties. The game features a large open world which can be explored either on foot or on 
            horseback. When facing enemies, the player can choose to engage in a direct confrontation using Jin's katana or to become a 
            legendary warrior known as "the Ghost" by using stealth tactics to assassinate opponents. A multiplayer mode titled Ghost of 
            Tsushima: Legends was released in October 2020 and made available separately in September 2021.
            Sucker Punch began developing the game after the release of Infamous First Light in 2014, as the studio wanted to move on from the 
            Infamous franchise to create a game with a heavy emphasis on melee combat. The studio collaborated with Japan Studio and visited 
            Tsushima Island twice to ensure that the game was as culturally and historically authentic as possible. The team was heavily 
            inspired by samurai cinema, particularly films directed by Akira Kurosawa, as well as the comic book series Usagi Yojimbo. 
            The game's landscape and minimalistic art style were influenced by Shadow of the Colossus, and locations in the game were 
            designed to be "the perfect photographer's dream". While the in-game landmass is similar in shape to Tsushima Island, the team 
            did not intend to create a one-to-one recreation. Ilan Eshkeri and Shigeru Umebayashi composed the game's soundtrack.
            The game was released for PlayStation 4 in July 2020, and an expanded version for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, subtitled 
            Director's Cut and featuring the Iki Island expansion, was released in August 2021. The Windows version of Director's Cut, 
            developed by Nixxes Software, was released in May 2024. The game received positive reviews upon release, with critics praising t
            he game's melee combat, story, characters, performances, and music, though it received some criticism for its implementations of 
            stealth gameplay and open world structure. The game was a commercial success, selling more than 9.73 million copies by July 2022 
            and was one of Sony's fastest-selling original games. It was nominated for several end-of-the-year awards, including Game of the 
            Year at The Game Awards 2020 and the 24th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards. A film adaptation is in development.</p>

        <h2 style="line-height: 16px;">God_Of_War</h2>
        <p class="p1">God of War is an action-adventure game franchise created by David Jaffe and developed by Sony's Santa Monica Studio. It began in 
            2005 on the PlayStation 2 (PS2) video game console and has become a flagship series for PlayStation, consisting of nine 
            installments across multiple platforms. Based on ancient mythologies, the series' plot follows Kratos, a Spartan warrior who 
            becomes the God of War and comes into conflict with various mythological pantheons. The earlier games in the series are based 
            on Greek mythology and see Kratos follow a path of vengeance against the Olympian gods; the later games are based on Norse 
            mythology and see Kratos go on a path of redemption while also introducing his son Atreus as a secondary protagonist.
            Santa Monica Studio has developed all main entries, while Ready at Dawn and Javaground/Sony Online Entertainment-Los Angeles 
            (SOE-LA) developed the three side games. Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) has published all games except the mobile phone 
            installment, which was published by Sony Pictures Digital. The first seven games make up the Greek era of the franchise. 
            God of War (2005), God of War II (2007) and God of War III (2010) comprise its main trilogy; the first two were released on 
            the PS2 with the third on the PlayStation 3 (PS3). A prequel, Ascension (2013), was also released for the PS3. Other games 
            include Chains of Olympus (2008) and Ghost of Sparta (2010) for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) and Betrayal (2007) for mobile 
            phones that supported the Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME). The Norse era began with the 2018 game God of War, which was 
            released for the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and later Windows in January 2022. It was accompanied by a short prequel, A Call from the 
            Wilds (2018), a text-based game through Facebook Messenger. A sequel, Ragnarök, was released in November 2022 for the PS4 and 
            PlayStation 5 (PS5) and concluded the Norse era, which received an epilogue in the form of an expansion pack titled Valhalla in 
            December 2023; a Windows port of Ragnarök is scheduled for September 2024.
            Games in the series have been praised as some of the best action games of all time. The series has received numerous awards, 
            including several Game of the Year recognitions for the 2005 and 2018 installments. Some games have also been remastered for 
            newer PlayStation platforms. As of November 2023, the franchise has sold an estimated 66+ million games worldwide, and is 
            PlayStation's most profitable first-party brand. Strong sales and support of the series led to the franchise's expansion into 
            other media, such as three comic book series and three novels. A film adaptation of the original installment had been in 
            development but was ultimately canceled; however, a television series adaptation of the Norse era is in development for Amazon 
            Prime Video.</p>

        <h2 style="line-height: 16px;">Hogwarts_Legacy</h2>
        <p class="p1">Hogwarts Legacy is a 2023 action role-playing game developed by Avalanche Software and published by Warner Bros. Games under its 
            Portkey Games label. The game is part of the Wizarding World franchise, taking place a century prior to the events chronicled in 
            the Harry Potter novels. The player controls a student enrolled in the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who learns to 
            wield an array of magical abilities and objects. With the assistance of fellow students and professors, the protagonist embarks 
            on a journey to unearth an ancient secret concealed within the wizarding world.
            Following their acquisition by Warner Bros. in 2017, Hogwarts Legacy marks the first release from Avalanche unrelated to
             Disney Interactive Studios and its products. Development commenced in 2018, while pre-release gameplay footage was leaked onto 
             the internet in the same year. The storyline was designed to take place in a period untouched by established Wizarding World 
             characters, offering players the opportunity to immerse themselves in their own distinct universe.
            The game garnered significant anticipation upon announcement in 2020. Prior to its release, it attracted controversy due to 
            Harry Potter creator J. K. Rowling's views on transgender people and accusations of including antisemitic tropes, leading to 
            calls for a boycott. Following some delays, it was released on 10 February 2023 for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S, 
            on 5 May 2023 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and on 14 November 2023 for Nintendo Switch. The early-access period of Hogwarts 
            Legacy resulted in record-breaking viewership on streaming platform Twitch, making it the most-watched single-player game of all 
            time on the platform.
            Within two weeks of launch, the game sold more than 12 million copies and generated $850 million in global sales revenue. As of 
            May 5, 2023, its revenue reached $1 billion, and by the beginning of 2024, global sales totaled 24 million copies. Hogwarts 
            Legacy received generally favourable reviews from critics, with praise for its combat, world design, characters, variety of 
            content, and faithfulness to the source material, but criticism for its lack of innovation as an open-world game and technical 
            problems. The game received various accolades, including nominations for two D.I.C.E. Awards, a Grammy Award for its soundtrack, 
            and two BAFTA Games Awards.</p>

        <p class="p1">Black Myth: Wukong is a 2024 action role-playing game developed and published by Game Science. The game is inspired by the 
            classical Chinese novel Journey to the West, and follows an anthropomorphic monkey based on the character of Sun Wukong from the 
            novel. It was released for PlayStation 5 and Windows on August 20, 2024 to generally favorable reviews from critics. The release
            date of the game for Xbox Series X/S has not yet been announced.
            Gameplay Black Myth: Wukong is an action role-playing game,with soulslike elements.It is played in single-player mode from a 
            third-person perspective.It is inspired by the classical Chinese novel Journey to the West.
            The player controls a monkey protagonist referred to as the Destined One, who is based on Sun Wukong from the novel.
            The protagonist's weapon is a staff, which is based on the Ruyi Jingu Bang from the novel.The staff can extend and shrink in 
            size during combat.The three staff stances, which are the smash stance, the pillar stance, and the thrust stance, provide 
            versatility in fights.The combat mechanics involve the management of resources.Focus can be accumulated by landing light attacks,
            executing well-timed dodges, and other means.A focus point is gained when the meter for focus is filled up.These points can 
            be used to initiate a varied combo, chained to light attacks, or to charge a heavy attack on its own.Stamina depletes by 
            sprinting, dodging, and attacking.
            Spells have cooldowns before they can be cast again and consume mana,which can be refilled at shrines.They are categorized in 
            mysticism, alteration, strand, and transformations.The protagonist uses transformations to shapeshift into a different 
            creature or being.An example is the transformation Red Tides, which takes the form of Guangzhi, a wolfman who wields a flaming 
            glaive.The transformations come with their own movesets and health.They are available on cooldown, but do not cost mana.
            They last until their might, which depletes by attacking, or health runs out.
            Spirits provide a skill and passive effect if they are equipped.Spirit skills function as transformations to do a single attack.
            They are available on cooldown and consume qi.Spirits come from certain defeated enemies and are acquired if they are absorbed 
            into a gourd.An example of a spirit is the Wandering Wight, who does a headbutt attack.
            The game follows a mostly linear progression interspersed with expansive areas.There are keeper's shrines, which act as 
            checkpoints for the player, along the way.Throughout the world, the protagonist encounters various yaoguai as enemies.
            The game's difficulty cannot be changed by players, but it does not remain the same throughout a playthrough.
